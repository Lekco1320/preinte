# preinte

Please forgive me for leaving a long paragraph of text written to let my annoyance out for lacking a visual tool to show what the STL containers contain while debugging and learning algorithm. I always need to set breakpoints manually, move my mouse onto the variables and wait for a small tip box to show up with folded information. Accordingly, I coded this and named it as ***preinte***, which is the origin of the word ***print*** from old French. I hope my commitment could also help you to debug while learning or working.

The project *preinte* contains two headers, instruction as well as examples about how to use these properly. Actually, I worked out the C version first, and the version for C++ was based on that. However, that C version was too crude to use, so I almost overwrote all code inherited from that. Even though I uploaded the C version, I do not recommend you to use that. Please use this version with C++ compiler if possible.

These two headers can be compiled by MSVC, GCC and Clang.(>=c++14) You can redistribute it and/or modify it without permission. Wish you happy coding. ðŸ˜Š
